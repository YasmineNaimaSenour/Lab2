The client needs to develop a console-based calculator in Java where the end-user can run it form the command line as : 
 java mySofware  op A B

 op is the operator and can be either : +,- , / , *
 A and B are two real numbers.

Example to run the software : 
 java mySoftware + 2 5


It will print to the console : 7

We need to strictly use OOP principles where we can create an abstract class called : Calculator with one abstract method called double compute(double A, double B). 
(The method from its signature, it computes and returns, it does not print).

Each type of operator needs to have its own class inheriting and implementing the method compute.

As a team in collaboration with the team leader:
Setup the Asana board for this project and use the Kanban view where you can set the task phases (idea,todo,in progress, to review, done)


Create the list of all tasks on Asana ( Programming, Testing, Packaging,Integration, System Administration....)


Team leader needs to set up the Git Repository and invite other members of the team.


Assign different programming tasks for team members where each member can create a separate class.


All team members would inspect the code (To look for errors, badly written code, non-readable business logicâ€¦)


Set the policy for communicating, reviewing and merging the pull requests


Learn how to use the git ignore file to skip tracking certain files ( Example .class files).


Package your software as a Jar File and deliver to another team where they can run the software.

Evaluation of the Exercise : 
All members are contributing fairly.
Project is delivered to another team and runs smoothly.

Extra : 
Does it handle errors when the users accidentally type incorrect format ? the user should be shown a message to input data in the required format instead of showing a technical exception message.


Does it handle division by zero ?


Does it handle negative numbers ?
